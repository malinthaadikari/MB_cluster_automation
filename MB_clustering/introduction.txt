There are two modules 

1. python module
2. puppet module

1. python module is for automating instaince booting, deleting, get-ip addresses...etc operations
2. puppet modules is for get the correct pack, unzip it into a given location ( currently clound instance ) , make configurations and start-up the carbon server

How things working...

1. There is a xml file inside the python module. Everything related to configuration changes should be mentioned there. Related .erb files should be included inside the templetes folder inside the pupprt module.
2. python module loolks at the xml and boot up instances in openstack account.
3. At the new instance's starup , it get the related part of the xml and make changes in the unziped carbon pack in it.
4. puppet master finally start-up the given carbon server inside the openstack instances.
